# üé® Confint Visualisations

**A collection of data visualisation ideas implemented in R ‚Äî free to use and adapt.**

During my career as a performance engineer I had to visualise the data in a way that helps to analyse and present it. And I must admit sometimes this turned to be quite tricky.

This project is more ofa a **set of concepts** rather than a code for visualising performance and statistical data in intuitive ways. Note that I am deliberately not including here anything very obvious, which is available elsewhere. I am not trying to create a library for any case, as there are great books available on that already, for example, [Fundamentals Of Data Visualisation](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/directory-of-visualizations.html) by Mr. Claus Wilke. I only want to provide personal ideas **which I found practical** in my work. Despite this is more about ideas, I provide code written in **R** language so you can reuse the ideas in your project or analysis.

Each **R** script represents a unique visualisation idea. And I will be adding more.

Note, that **R** is just an instrument ‚Äî you can reproduce the same ideas in Python, JavaScript, or any other tool you'd like.

## üß≠ Overview

Each file in this repository corresponds to one visualisation concept:

| Script                                                                                      | Purpose                                                    | Example                              |

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone this repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/confint-visualisations.git
   ```

2. Open R and source any script you want to explore:  
   ```r
   source("and_candles_for_all.R")
   generate_candles_chart(your_data, "Login")
   ```

3. Or use built-in data generators provided in each script.

## üß† Concept

These visualisations aim to:
- Make statistical characteristics **visually intuitive**
- Enhance classic plots (boxplots, histograms) with **context and comparability**
- Support **performance testing and SLA analysis**
